        </div>
            <p>Energy is everywhere. It powers your morning coffee, fuels your commute, and keeps your phone alive. But what exactly is it? At its core, energy is the ability to do work—whether that’s moving, heating, lighting, or running machines. It can’t be created or destroyed, only transformed. Understanding energy helps us make better choices about how we use it, from personal consumption to global sustainability.</p>        
            <br><br>
            <h3>The Many Faces of Energy</h3>
            <p>Energy comes in different forms, but they all boil down to two main types:</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Kinetic Energy – Energy in motion. A rolling ball, flowing water, or a speeding car all have kinetic energy.</p>
            <p>Potential Energy – Stored energy. A stretched rubber band, a charged battery, or a boulder at the top of a hill are full of potential.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Within these, we find specific types:</P>
            <br><br>
            <p>Mechanical Energy – The sum of an object's kinetic and potential energy, seen in moving gears or a swinging pendulum.<P>

            <p>Mechanical Wave Energy – Energy carried by oscillations in matter, such as seismic waves in earthquakes.<P>
            <p>Sound Wave Energy – A specific type of mechanical wave energy that travels through air, water, or solids, allowing us to hear.<P>
            <p>Radiant Energy – Energy carried by electromagnetic waves, including visible light, X-rays, and radio waves.<P>
            <p>Rest Energy – The energy stored in an object's mass, as described by Einstein’s equation E = mc².<P>
            <p>Thermal Energy – The energy of moving particles within a substance, responsible for heat.<P>
            <br><br>
            <p>Every day, you interact with these energy types—whether you realize it or not.</p>
            <h4>Units of Measure</h4>
            <p>The joule is the standard unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI). It measures the work done when a force of one newton moves an object one meter. Energy can also be measured in other units, including ergs, calories, kilowatt-hours, and British thermal units. Each requires a conversion factor when expressed in joules.</p>
            <p>Power, the rate at which energy is used, is measured in watts. One watt is equal to one joule per second. A watt-hour is 3600 joules. The erg is the unit of energy in the CGS system, while the foot-pound is used in the imperial and US customary systems. Other units such as the electronvolt and food calorie are used in specialized fields.</p>
            <p>In 1843, physicist James Prescott Joule discovered that a descending weight could transfer energy to water through friction. This experiment demonstrated the relationship between mechanical work and heat, laying the foundation for modern energy measurement.</P>
